This blog is made of one philosophy and four pillars: it should cost exactly 
nothing and all the software you need are the following.

1. The R programming language for data analysis.

2. The R Markdown language for content generation and typesetting.

3. Blogdown in conjunction with Hugo to generate the web pages.

4. Github-Pages for webhosting.

This post will mainly briefly touch on 1 and 2 then focus on 3 and 4 so you can 
get your own blog up and running if you want to follow in my footsteps. 

## The R Programming Language

R is a programming language designed for statistics. It has very powerful 
data manipulation and 2d plotting capabilities. However to use it to its full 
potential you need to let go of graphical user interfaces and start writing R 
scripts. If you have always relied on GUI before, you should know that having to 
code everything is a good thing! Imagine having to explain to someone which buttons 
to click and how far he has to move the slider to get the same result you have. 
If you did everything in R all you need to do is just showing them the code.

To get R up and running on your computer, download and install the R distribution 
for your operating system from the [official website](https://cran.r-project.org/)

## R Markdown

The most important motivation to go this route is none other than R Markdown. 
You can think of R Markdown as a language that allows you to quickly generate 
decent looking webpages with embedded R codes, graphics and even $\LaTeX$ 
expressions for mathematical equations. It is an incredibly efficient language 
in the sense that almost every single thing you type goes directly to the content 
you want to show to your audience as opposed to tweaking varius display or 
formatting parameters.

I use the popular [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop) 
to write R Markdown files. Be sure to install R first if you haven't done so 
already.
